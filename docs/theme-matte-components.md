# Matte Theme

Matte is a basic, neutral-looking theme for HTML5 controls and inputs. You can use it as a wireframe for prototypes or starting point for creating your own custom theme.

Matte is not included in the default application template. To use Matte in your projects, you have to install it first:

1. Use your command line tool to switch to your project directory.

    ```
    cd yourpojectfolder
    ```
    
2. At the prompt, enter:

    ```
    npm install matte@latest --save
    ```
    
    The `--save` flag ensures that the matte package is automatically added as a dependency to the package.json file of your application code.
