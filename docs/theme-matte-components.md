## Installing the Matte Theme

Matte is not included in the default application template. To use Matte in your projects, you have to install it first:

1. Use your command line tool to switch to your project directory.

    ```
    cd yourpojectfolder
    ```
    
2. At the prompt, enter:

    ```
    npm install matte@latest --save
    ```
    
    The `--save` flag ensures that the matte package is automatically added as a dependency to the package.json file of your application code.
