This is the repo for the [montagejs.org](http://montagejs.org) website.

## Contributing
If you find any bugs or want to contribute, feel free to create an issue or send a pull request.

## Building

Run `./build.sh`. It will take it's time installing gems to compile the Wiki
into HTML. In the end the `deploy/` directory contains the gh-pages of this
repo, with a new commit containing any updates. This can be pushed to gh-pages.

Before you push make sure you have committed your changes and then built, so
that the gh-pages commit message has the correct commit hash.

Thanks!
